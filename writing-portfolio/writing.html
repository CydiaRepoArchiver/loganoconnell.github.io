									<span style="padding-left: 3em"></span>I don’t talk about it. It’s just easier to keep it a tucked-away secret than to explain it to someone and face the typical teenage “so you’re a nerd?” backlash. I’ve always just kept the thoughts, ideas, and projects to myself, for my brain and mine only. Over time though, I’ve grown a bit more comfortable sharing my passion with others. Some of my friends know all about it, some of them no nothing. I’m a normal teenager on the outside; I do my homework most of the time, I’m lazy, I play sports with my best friends, I blast music in my car, and I love going to parties and the beach. I fill my summer with concerts and spend plenty of time with my girlfriend. Basically your run-of-the-mill, fun-loving kid. Except when I’m alone in my room with my computer, then another person comes out. I love technology, circuitry, hardware, software, and anything electronic. I program my own apps, devices, and controllers. My room is something of a shrine to all the projects I’ve created. Wires hang down off circuit boards, devices are plugged into outlets and sensors and other devices, and there’s screens of information plastered everywhere. I’ve taken apart phones, made my bedroom automated, and I have coding information sheets plastered in a neat array on one of my walls. It’s something of a nightmare to the average person who walks in. Technology is honestly a massive part of my life and something I enjoy very deeply. I spend a lot of time with it, but I’ve always struggled to understand why I actually hide what I do from others. For example, my family had no idea one of my apps had made a thousand dollars until the check cashed into my mom’s bank account, because I had decided to talk to her once she found out and would keep it a secret until then. Of course, they questioned where I was really getting the money, but I showed them that I had been practicing my skills for years and they had finally paid off. Shocked, my parents rushed to post it on Facebook, the typical parent-bragging move of modern times. I was horrified at this. People were going to know I was a “nerd” now. My friends I met a few summers ago have been really encouraging and interested of my projects and such, and their support has made me much more confident and open about it. However, I still sometimes wonder why I would hide or tuck away such a big part of myself, and why I have trouble explaining my passion.

									Life is like a light.<br />
									It can shine very brightly, and proudly.<br />
									It can shine much dimmer, yet stronger.<br /><br />
									 
									Sometimes, a feeling swells inside us,<br />
									Saying you’re tired, you want to detach,<br />
									Yourself from this weary earth, move on,<br />
									Let your light fade away like a blown match.<br /><br />
									 
									This feeling is monstrous, oppressive,<br />
									But yet, some survive, and grip tighter.<br />
									Our souls are not measured in reached goals,<br />
									But how hard we fought to shine brighter.<br />
