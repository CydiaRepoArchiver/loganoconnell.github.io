									<span style="padding-left: 3em"></span>I knew it was going to be a difficult conversation. You see, my mother’s never really allowed me to have a sleepover. Ever. Even if my friend lived across the street, I received an instant “no” when asking my mother about a sleepover. “Friends are always welcome here,” she would chant, a phrase burned so deep in my mind I can still hear her tone when thinking about it. And I did have friends over, and we had many sleepovers in my basement. We would play Wii games, have junk food, and do typical teenage boy things. Those nights were great. But there were other, more lonesome nights, when I knew my friends were having an incredible time at someone else’s house for a sleepover. Confined to my bedroom, I had little more than the laughter’s of past sleepovers to bounce of the walls as I slowly lulled to sleep. It had been a lifelong battle with my mother, and I knew she had her justified reasons, but as a kid I was passionate and stubborn with my thinking.
									<br /><span style="padding-left: 3em"></span>My mother used to work long shifts in the Emergency Room at Children’s Hospital, and her days consisted of school all day then the hospital till 3 AM where she would sleep for a few hours until getting back up for class. Her work ethic was something of a superhuman. In the E.R. however, she came across the most horrifying of tragedy victims, ones that would leave her prone to worrying about her own kids. My beloved mother saw people with shattered jaws and hanging teeth from falling off ladders, people with items sticking out of various body parts, and countless burn victims. One that she never forgot was a younger boy, around 12 years old, who was sleeping over his best friend’s house when a fire was started accidentally. Asleep, he woke up with absolutely no idea how to exit the new layout of the house. It took him much too long to find an exit, and the young boy suffered head to toe burns that caked and boiled his skin.
									<br /><span style="padding-left: 3em"></span>Horrified, the memories of that boy drove my mom’s hatred of sleepovers to the level it is at today. Knowing this in the back of my mind, I planned how to subtly bring up the prospect of sleeping at a friend’s house after prom with the rest of my group. She could not be thrilled. I asked her, and instantly we entered a heated battle. She was crying and yelling, I was frustrated and angry. My mom was not budging with her morals and understanding that I was smart and was going to be 18 in a few months, I deserved a night to be enjoy and spend with my friends. Hopping in my car, I took off for no man’s land. I had no destination, just a need for a journey. The loud music and focus it took to drive allowed me to not be able to think, I was able to be mindless and forget what was happening. I was nothing and yet something at the same time; my mind was off and yet on. Eventually, I went home. But I took a while.
									<br /><span style="padding-left: 3em"></span>Coming home, my mom hugged me and we both apologized. We both knew we had to find a happy medium and solve the issue in front of us. Going to sleep, I woke up the next day and stumbled down the stairs groggily. She told me of how her and my father had decided to allow me to stay the night at my friend’s, and I’ve never smiled harder and hugged my mom so tight. It was a tough battle, but everyone was happy in the end.

									Life is like a light.<br />

									It can shine much dimmer, yet stronger.<br /><br />
									 
									Sometimes, a feeling swells inside us,<br />
									Saying you’re tired, you want to detach,<br />
									Yourself from this weary earth, move on,<br />
									Let your light fade away like a blown match.<br /><br />
									 
									This feeling is monstrous, oppressive,<br />
									But yet, some survive, and grip tighter.<br />
									Our souls are not measured in reached goals,<br />
									But how hard we fought to shine brighter.<br />
