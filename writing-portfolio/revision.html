									<h3>Drafting Process</h3>
									<p><span style="padding-left: 3em"></span>The drafting process for this essay was a long, winding road for me. In the beginning, I struggled to correctly formulate a thesis that brought together both books and allowed me to approach an end-game that was arguable. I went through many revisions of different thesis but finally settled on one I was proud of and felt I could back up effectively. During the peer thesis editing, mine was heavily edited by my classmates and they helped it become much more clear. In the end, I used how Holden survived mental deterioration through Phoebe and compared that to how Holden accepted his own death because he lacked an outlet to output his problems. With the thesis nailed down, I turned my focus to finding quotes and reoccuring evidence. It took time, but I found quotes that supported my claim really well and I drafted quote markups and analyzed them. That was probably the most difficult part of this essay's drafting process. Once the quotes were found and the evidence laid out, it was simply explaining how the quotes and their deeper meaning related back to my thesis. At first, my rough draft did not come out quite how I wanted it too, so I went back to my outline and started over, focusing more on explaining how I got my analysis from the quotes and how it all connected to my claim. I was happy with my second rough draft, and after peer edits and my own multiple revisions the essay was finished.</p>

									<h3>Original</h3>
									<p><span style="padding-left: 3em"></span>For Holden, the world around him is intensely imperfect and this troubles him deeply. Holden struggles to cope with the idea of “phonies” participating in his daily life. With this struggle, Holden begins to isolate himself, pushing away from society as a whole and retracting into his personal bubble. Whilst alone, he can be free from the consequences of knowing what is wrong with society. Holden wishes people to be honest and truthful towards one another, but societal conventions yield that white lies and dishonesty are normal, and he can not process this. However, instead of overcoming this struggle to cope with imperfection, he recedes farther back into his mind, corrupting his own thoughts in the process. Holden uses “phonies” as reasoning for his isolation from society and its’ conventions, notably visible when he dropped out of school. “One of the biggest reasons I left Elkton Hills was because I was surrounded by phonies. That's all. They were coming in the goddam window. I can't stand that stuff. It drives me crazy. It makes me so depressed I go crazy. I hated that goddam Elkton Hills” (Salinger 60). The idea that someone could be untruthful was so mentally exhausting and emotionally taxing that he left his school and future behind. Clearly, Holden takes issue with coping with imperfections in his surrounding life. Rather than turn his focus to his school work and persevere, Holden participates in self-destruction through his hatred of phoniness as it “drives [him] crazy” and “makes [him] so depressed”. He wishes for everyone to be perfect humans, when in reality people lie and are fake. Whilst setting the bar for society so high, Holden makes it impossible for people to live up to his expectations, forcing him into isolation and depression. Even Mr. Antolini tries to help him see how degrading yet natural his reasoning is, albeit to no avail. “‘You're not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior...Many, many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now’” (Salinger 61). Holden rarely engages in good encounters with people, and wishes people could act honest towards each other; he exhibits how his past history has grasped his mind and is inciting insanity. Holden’s trapped in a whirlwind of lies around him, and no one’s there for him to scream the truth. There is no outlet, no source for him to expedite his knowledge to, and madness is ensuing. This inability to process the diversity of life leads him to distance himself from society as a whole, running away from his problems and in addition having spouts of depression.</p>
