									<h3><i>The Great Gatsby</i> Chapter 5 - 6 Paragraph</h3>
									<p>In the story, The Great Gatsby, by F. Scott Fitzgerald, Jay Gatsby displays nervousness when his long-lost love Daisy plans to come to Nick’s house for tea.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-arrow-down">
									<h3>The Great Gatsby Essay</h3>
									<p><i>In The Great Gatsby</i> by F. Scott Fitzgerald, Gatsby uses his wealthy facade of happiness and independence to cope with his discontent over the present without Daisy through parties, frantic preparation for her, and showing off his fine shirts, but in the end his facade fails him, leading to his death.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-check">
									<h3>Comparative Essay</h3>
									<p>Holden and Hamlet mentally deteriorate through a loss of interest in life when pushed into isolating themselves from others; however, Holden survives this spurt of uninterest through talking with Phoebe, while Hamlet accepts death because he lacks an outlet, highlighting the importance that to cope with the disillusionment of an imperfect life an outlet is necessary.</p>

							<h3 id="writingprogress2" style="text-transform: uppercase; text-align: left">2. Quote Analysis</h3>
							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon fa-arrow-down">
									<h3><i>The Great Gatsby</i> Chapter 1 - 3 Paragraph</h3>
									<p>“His family were enormously wealthy - even in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach…They had spent a year in France for no particular reason,” (p. 6). Fitzgerald clearly expresses his unrest with the massive wealth split being formed in the United States, which further takes away from the American Dream and the beginning promises of this country. Tom and Daisy have rarely worked in their life, and they chose to travel around Europe and burn money for having nothing better to do. Spending money like that exemplifies how some people should not have as much wealth as they do and share some of it with the struggling poor who wake up every morning and work hard all day for a few dollars.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-arrow-down">
									<h3><i>Crime and Punishment</i> I - II Assignment</h3>
									<p>“‘Do they know everything, or do they still not know?...Mocking, sounding me out- and then all of a sudden they’ll come in and say they knew it all long ago…’” (Dostoevsky 122). The fear of his actions led Raskolnikov to believe that his conversation with his two friends were a set up and they knew about his murderous actions. In reality, they knew nothing, but the guilt made him believe that the talk was of himself, just as Chaucer said in his quote. The fear of being discovered for whatever one has done drives anxiety into the mind, and talk will suddenly trigger the notion that it is about them. Talk is perceived by the guilty as being about themselves because of the overload of fear. Raskolnikov, full of fear, was distraught in his quote because he believed Razumikhin and Zametov were onto him, exactly as Chaucer predicted.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-check">
									<h3>Comparitive Essay</h3>
									<p> “‘Jane Gallagher. Jesus’ ... I couldn't get her off my mind. I really couldn't. "I oughta go down and say hello to her, at least." "Why the hell don'tcha, instead of keep saying it?" Stradlater said. I walked over to the window, but you couldn't see out of it, it was so steamy from all the heat in the can.. "I'm not in the mood right now,"...You have to be in the mood for those things. […] I walked around the can for a little while. I didn't have anything else to do. (Salinger 42-43). The window directly coincides with Holden’s mood-lacking mindset of Jane. Holden, looking out the window, would have likely seen a campus with shady trees and bustling people, but that was tarnished by the intense steam from the bathroom. Stradlater had showered recently, and the window was becoming fogged up, similar to how Holden’s perfect view of Jane was no longer impeccable. From his childhood, Holden remembers Jane as the ideal girl, and their memories are encased in laughter and fun in his mind. However, deep down, he knows that she’s no longer the perfect girl for him when he rejects going down to see her, falsely claiming he is “not in the mood”. In Holden’s mind, she definitely has grown flaws he would despise because of his perfectionist attitude.</p>

									<h3>Reflection on myself as a writer</h3>
									<p><span style="padding-left: 3em"></span>I feel as though I have significantly progressing in my writing this year in many ways. First, I realized that it is not the length of the writing that helps explain one’s point and solidify the argument, it is the way you analyze the evidence and incorporate different English tactics into your writing in order to persuade the reader towards your point. This year I worked on improving my analytical skills of quotes, and not saying the typical “this quote means…” and then restating the plot. I have been delving deeper into the quotes and improving my skills at pulling apart and marking them up. In my Comparative Essay, I feel as though my quote markup was a drastic improvement from the beginning of the year, and I took different pieces of the quote and used them to prove my point to the reader. I feel more confident in my ability to markup a quote and develop an argument based off of what I find. Also, my writing has progressed in the revisionary stage I believe. In the past few years I have flown through an assignment and not bothered to go back and proofread my small essays, and this year I changed that bad habit. I took the time to go back, edit my writing, and shape it into a more cohesive, comprehensible piece that I was, in turn, much more proud of. This extra revisionary step helped me gain more knowledge of my writing errors and where I can improve myself when writing. The activity that helped me progress most in these aspects of my writing was the quote markup examples given in class. Going through a quote, breaking it apart, and sharing out ideas as a class was very beneficial in understanding how I can more effectively look at the quotes myself, and sharing ideas with others helped me to see new perspectives and ideas that I may have missed at a first glance. Overall, I believe my writing has improved greatly from the beginning of the year to now, and I am proud of the work I have done to better myself.</p>
