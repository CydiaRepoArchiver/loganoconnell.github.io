								<h2>Antonio Rita - My Great-Grandfather</h2>
								<p>He immigrated from Cabra, Guarda, Portugal to the United States and brought along his son (my grandfather). This journey over to the US was the beginning of his family (which led to my mom being born and eventually me) and an example of how the American dream brought people from all over the world. They traveled to America during the aftermath of the Great Depression and World War II. Life was hard, but he settled down and made a life for the Rita family.</p>

								<h2>Information</h2>
								<p>Facts that surrounded the Portugese immigration during the late 1940s.</p>
							</header>
							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon fa-bank">
									<h3>Government</h3>
									<p>Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar was named the prime minister of Portugal in 1932. Salazar was a bad leader, especially in the sense that his people had very few rights and were surveilled by secret polive. In addition, the richer people in Portugal got special priviledges over the poor. Salazar didn't die until 1968.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-map-marker">
									<h3>Why They Came Here</h3>
									<p>Many Portugese immigrated to the US for betting living conditions and nothing more. They wanted to escape debt and taxation issues. Males were forced to do army service in the Portugese force, so that was another reason many left. A combination of natural disasters also pushed many people out of the country. The US was a nation headed for the future,  and some just needed food for their families.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-life-ring">
									<h3>Lifestyle</h3>
									<p>The change in environment brought many change s to the Portugese immigrants lifestyle. With the men being given low wages in America, most women had to work to help families survive. There was no support from their extended family; they were alone. Through generations, their children's language ability improved.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-line-chart">
									<h3>Statistics</h3>
									<p>Less immigrants began arriving during the time my great-grandfather came because of the Great Depression, only around 500,000 people a year.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-ban">
									<h3>Immigration Restrictions</h3>
									<p>In the 1880s, nativists started to favor native-born Americans. The group of nativists ended up securing power in Congress that allowed the government to take over immigration. Certain Immigration Acts were passed in 1891, 1917, 1921, 1924 and limited the abilities of non-natives. The stock market crashed in 1929 and spawned the Great Depression; the natives were treated even worse.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-ship">
									<h3>How Most Got Here</h3>
									<p>The biggest wave of Portuges immigration to the US occured between the late 19th century and early 20th century. Most immigrants came to Southern New England, New York, Hawaii, or San Francisco. They commonly immigrated as families, because of course immigrants would feel safer that way. Whaling ships were the main form of transportation to the US, and they especially came to New England. Those going to Hawaii commonly rode on sugar ships.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-frown-o">
									<h3>The Impact of the Great Depression</h3>
									<p>The Great Depression was especiialy difficult for minorites like Portugese immigrants. The unemployment rate of American minorites was over 50%. Racial discrimination was widespread, and minorities were often denied jobs that were supposedly available to all citizens. Charities would not give them food, and violence skyrocketed. In addition, some minorities were even excluded from Union membership.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-book">
									<h3>Legacy</h3>
									<p>The Great Depression left a legacy of migration. The Portugese immigratnts lived in constant fear that their job could be taken away and their life would be instantly destroyed. This insecurity led to the immigrants saving money and spending it wisely, "just in case", and it still happens today.</p>
