								<h2>Narrative: Antonio Rita - My Great-Grandfather</h2>
								<p>Antonio Rita immigrated from Cabra, Guarda, Portugal to the United States and brought along his son (my grandfather). This journey over to the US was the beginning of his family (which led to my mom being born and eventually me) and an example of how the American dream brought people from all over the world. They traveled to America during the aftermath of the Great Depression and World War II, when immigration was tough. Life was hard, but he settled down and made a life for the Rita family.</p>

								<h2>When My Great-Grandfather<br/>
								Immigrated to the US</h2>
								<p>My great-grandfather came to the US when he was 28 in 1948 on a ship called the Nea Hellas. He brought along my grandfather, Gabriel Rita, who was only 3 years old. They emmigrated from Cabra, Guarda, Portugal and landed in New York, NY. Eventually, he settled down with the rest of his family in Cumberland, RI.</p>

								<h2>What Life Was Like in America</h2>
								<p>Life in America was hard for Antonio Rita, and he could not find a job besides being a basic laborer. As a laborer, he most likely did whatever job he could find, like harvesting farms or public service works. Only bringing in $5,000 a year, money was extremely tight. However, by the time the rest of his family came to the United States, he had enough money saved to keep his family afloat.</p>

								<h2>Why He Immigrated to the US</h2>
								<p>Antonio Rita most likely immigrated to the US to escape the lowering poiitical and economic conditions in Portugal and to seek out a more successful and better life in America for his family. The American Dream was a popular idea at the time, and with worsening conditions in his home country, America must have seemed like the perfect opportunity for Antonio Rita.</p>

								<h2>Information</h2>
								<p>Facts about Portugese immigration during the late 1940s.</p>
							</header>
							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon fa-bank">
									<h3>Government</h3>
									<p>Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar was named the prime minister of Portugal in 1932. Salazar was a bad leader, especially in the sense that his people had very few rights and were surveilled by secret police. In addition, the richer people in Portugal got special priviledges over the poor. Unfortunately, Salazar didn't die until 1968, which caused many people to seek refuge in the US.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-map-marker">
									<h3>Why They Came Here</h3>
									<p>Many Portugese immigrated to the US for betting living conditions and nothing more. They wanted to escape debt, taxation, and governmental issues. Males were forced to do army service in the Portugese force, so that was another reason many left. A combination of natural disasters also pushed many people out of the country. The US was a nation headed for the future, and that drove some immigrants to come here. However, others just needed food for their families.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-life-ring">
									<h3>Lifestyle</h3>
									<p>The change in environment brought many changes to the Portugese immigrant's lifestyle. With the men being given low wages in America, most women had to work too to help their families survive. There was no support from their extended family (unlike their home country); they were alone. Through generations, their children's language ability improved and they became more culturized.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-line-chart">
									<h3>Statistics</h3>
									<p>Less immigrants began arriving during the time my great-grandfather came because of the Great Depression, only around 500,000 people a year. This was an 87.5% decrease from the 4 million people that immigrated to the US in the 1920s.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-ban">
									<h3>Immigration Restrictions</h3>
									<p>In the 1880s, a group called nativists who favored native-born Americans began to gain traction. The growing group of nativists ended up securing power in Congress that allowed the government to restrict immigration. Certain Immigration Acts were passed in 1891, 1917, 1921, 1924 and limited the abilities of non-natives. These restrictions made it hard for someone like my great-grandfather to pass stereotypes and form a solid living for his family. When the stock market crashed in 1929, the Great Depression was spawned; the natives were treated even worse.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-ship">
									<h3>How Most Got Here</h3>
									<p>The biggest wave of Portugese immigration to the US occured between the late 19th century and early 20th century. Most immigrants came to Southern New England, New York, Hawaii, or San Francisco. They commonly immigrated as families, because obviously immigrants would feel safer that way. Whaling ships were the main form of transportation to the US, and they especially came to New England. Those going to Hawaii commonly rode on sugar ships through the Pacific.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-frown-o">
									<h3>The Impact of the Great Depression</h3>
									<p>The Great Depression was especiialy difficult for minorites like Portugese immigrants. The unemployment rate of American minorites was over 50%. Racial discrimination was widespread, and minorities were often denied jobs that were supposedly available to all citizens. Charities would not give them food, and violence skyrocketed. In addition, some minorities were even excluded from union membership. These disastrous circumstances were still there when Antonio Rita came to America with my grandfather.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-book">
									<h3>Legacy</h3>
									<p>The Great Depression left a legacy of migration. The Portugese immigratnts lived in constant fear that their job could be taken away and their life would be instantly destroyed. This insecurity led to the immigrants saving money and spending it wisely, "just in case", and this still happens today.</p>
