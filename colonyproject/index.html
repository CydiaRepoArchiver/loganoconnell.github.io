								<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
									<p>In September of 1609, a man named Henry Hudson who was captaining a ship to find a northern passage to India reached what would soon become New York. He was an Englishman employed by the Dutch East India Company to find an unexpected route to India, but he was stuck when he reached Newfoundland up in Canada. Hudson eventually found his way to Albany.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="4u$ 12u$(medium)">
									<p>He loved what he found, and returned to England and told the king and his Dutch employers of his findings. Holland and England began sending over people to establish the colonies, and forts began to be built.The Dutch and English did not get along while they were building up their seperate communites, and the English attempted to seize control over the land. The Dutch surrendered, but reluctantly so.</p>

							<h2>The New York Colony's History Continued</h2>
							<p>What else brought New York to fruition?</p>
						</header>
						<p><br />A man by the name of Peter Minuits arrived on a ship provided by the Dutch West India Company arrived in what was now called New Amsterdam in 1625. He was appointed governer by his employers and the colony began to move and develop. In the meantime, the some dishonest Dutch traders had angered the Indians that had settled there before anyone. It turned into a bloodbath, and many lives on both sides were lost. The Dutch had wrestled the land back from the English, but trouble was brewing between the two, and they lost the land to England in the end. The colony was also renamed to New York in that time, after the Duke of York and Albany, the brother of King Charles II of England.</p>
