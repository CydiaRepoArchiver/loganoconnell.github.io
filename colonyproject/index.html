								</div>
								<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
									<p>In September of 1609, a man named Henry Hudson, an Englishman employed by the Dutch East India Company, who was captaining a ship to find a northern passage to India, reached Newfoundland, Canada and eventually found his way to Albany. He returned to England and told the king and his Dutch employers of his findings. Holland and England began sending over people to establish the colonies, and forts began to be built. They did not get along, </p>
								</div>
								<div class="4u$ 12u$(medium)">
									<p>but the English gained control over the land.A man by the name of Peter Minuits arrived on a ship provided by the Dutch West India Company arrived in what was now called New Amsterdam in 1625. He was appointed governer by his employers and the colony began to move and develop. Also, some dishonest Dutch traders had angered the Indians. This turned into a bloodbath, and many lives on both sides were lost. The colony was later renamed to New York.</p>

							<h2>Reasons To Come The New York Colony</h2>
							<p>What makes us different from the other colonies?</p>
						</header>
						<ul><br />
							<li>Diversity: The New York Colony is a very diverse and varied colony compared to the others. The Swedish, Dutch, English, and Native Americans all reside here in peace together (for the most part). We take pride in being a sort of cultural melting pot out here in the New World. Anyone is welcome here.</li>
						    <li>Natural Resources: There is an abundance of natural resources in our colony, and with such resources come opportunities for those like you. Farmland is present throughout the colony, with a good-fitting climate to help expand crop-growing season. Timber, furs, coal, and our expansive selection of iron ore available in the ground are perfect chances waiting for you.</li>

									<h3>Economy</h3>
									<p>Our economy is booming with the exportation of mainly corn, wheat, livestock, and industrial materials like our natural resources. We are considered the breadbasket colony because of all the wheat we produce.</p>
								</section>
								<section class="4u 6u$(medium) 12u$(xsmall)">
									<span class="icon alt major fa-globe"></span>
									<h3>Geography</h3>
									<p>Our geography is spot on for settling down, with mountains and water falls to the north (if you are the more outgoing type), and lots of flat, coastal plains that could not be better for farming.</p>
								</section>
								<section class="4u$ 6u(medium) 12u$(xsmall)">
									<span class="icon alt major fa-sun-o"></span>
									<h3>Climate</h3>
									<p>With mild winters that could include some snowfall, how fun is that! Kids love the snow, and we think our colony would suit them well. Our summers are decently warm, so you can enjoy the bright sun and humidity all summer long.</p>
								</section>
								<section class="4u 6u$(medium) 12u$(xsmall)">
									<span class="icon alt major fa-briefcase"></span>
									<h3>Workforce</h3>
									<p>Our workforce is strong and diverse, with our citizens doing many different things to help our economy. Some farm. others mine, and others work for businesses or the government. You choose your life in the New York Colony.</p>
								</section>
								<section class="4u 6u(medium) 12u$(xsmall)">
									<span class="icon alt major fa-home"></span>
									<h3>Residencies</h3>
									<p>Housing in our colony is very nice, as by now we have been able to build small cabins and huts thanks to some intuition from the Native Americans. Rest comfortably without any hassle.</p>
								</section>
								<section class="4u$ 6u$(medium) 12u$(xsmall)">
									<span class="icon alt major fa-users"></span>
									<h3>Government</h3>
									<p>Our colony is currently ruled by the English, and we are treated as a Royal Colony, Yes, we do have to pay taxes, but our rulers treat us well and fair over here. Their support is needed in our success.</p>
